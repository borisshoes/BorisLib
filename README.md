# Welcome to BorisLib!
### This is a Library for most of my heavier Server-Sided Fabric Mods

This library has a few key features:
- Polymer-based Graphical Items for server-sided GUIs
- A robust framework for generating paged and configurable server-sided GUIs
- A built-in powerful mod config / properties file manager
- A game-event system for keeping track of specific player actions
- A timer and login callback system for events that take place after a certain amount of time, or when a player returns to the server.
- A server-based velocity tracker for estimating the player's movement vectors without specialized packets
- A library of modular, pre-made, geometric and animated particle effects
- A whole bunch of useful utility methods for various mathematical operations, data structures, algorithms, text and sounds.
